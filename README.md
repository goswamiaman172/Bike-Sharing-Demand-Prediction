# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction
The Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Prediction dataset we use for the Bike Sharing Demand Prediction.
In this project, we need to find the prediction of Bike Sharing Demand. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes become a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes. In the given dataset there are many features given and we did the exploratory data analysis and also find the best suitable model for the problem.
When we use all the approaches we find that-
•	People like to ride bikes when it is pretty hot around 25°C on average
•	In morning hours(8-9) and in evening hours (5-8), the bikes taken for     
  rental are more.
•	So let's focus on the seasons where we have the most rents because at the   
  the month of May (5) to July (7) bikes have the most rented.
•	Bikes taken for rental are more in Summer and less in Winter
•	Here we see at the weekend Bike goes to be rented less compare to the   
  working days.
•	During No Holidays, the bikes taken for rental are more than 
  during holidays.
•	Bikes for rental are very high during functioning days.
•	Number of Bike Rented in a day is high as compare to the night
•	During Summer, rented bikes are more in each hour than other seasons
•	During Winter, rented bikes are less in each hour compared to other   
  Seasons.
•	On Saturday and Sunday we see the Bike rented is less but at the evening    
  time it goes bit up.
•	Monday to Friday all the hours seem like the same for the Rented Bike   
  count.
•	Used many of the algorithms to check for the best-predicted results but 
  the Random Forest model looks better as compared to the other models.   
  The MSE: 0.23  RMSE: 0.48   R2: 0.83  Accuracy: 93.93  for Random   
  Forest.
